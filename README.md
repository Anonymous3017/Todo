This project is a Flask-based Todo application that incorporates user authentication, session management, and database operations. Users can register, log in, and securely manage their todo tasks, including creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. The application leverages the Flask-Login module to handle user sessions, ensuring secure login functionality. It utilizes SQLAlchemy for data persistence and provides basic form validation and error handling. The user-friendly interface and robust features make it an ideal foundation for building a secure and efficient todo management system.
